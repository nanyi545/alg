 Q1: We have a bag containing numbers 1, 2, 3, â€¦, 100. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.
 Q2: That is correct, but now how would you do this if TWO numbers are missing?
 Qk: If exactly k numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?

 Remember sum of i-th powers, where i=1,2,..,k. This reduces the problem to solving the system of equations

 a1 + a2 + ... + ak = b1

 a1^2 + a2^2 + ... + ak^2 = b2

 ...

 a1^k + a2^k + ... + ak^k = bk
