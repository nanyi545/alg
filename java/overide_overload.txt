1)	Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program.	Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of the method that is already provided by its super class.
2)	Method overloading is performed within class.	Method overriding occurs in two classes that have IS-A (inheritance) relationship.
3)	In case of method overloading, parameter must be different.	In case of method overriding, parameter must be same.
4)	Method overloading is the example of compile time polymorphism.	Method overriding is the example of run time polymorphism.
5)	In java, method overloading can't be performed by changing return type of the method only. Return type can be same or different in method overloading. But you must have to change the parameter.	Return type must be same or covariant in method overriding.

Method overloading --> custom view/viewgroup in constructors

------------------static method------------------------------------

static class Class1 {
    public static int Method1(){
          return 0;
    }
}
static class Class2 extends Class1 {
    public static int Method1(){
          return 1;
    }

}
public static class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
          //Must explicitly chose Method1 from Class1 or Class2
          Class1.Method1();
          Class2.Method1();
    }
}


Static methods can not be overridden because there is nothing to override, as they would be two different methods

static methods can be overloaded just like any other method
