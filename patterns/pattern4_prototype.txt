This pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly. For example, an object is to be created after a costly database operation. We can cache the object, returns its clone on next request and update the database as and when needed thus reducing database calls.

(costly  -->  It could be in terms of memory or computation for example)

** 保护性拷贝:当你不希望一个对象被修改时（除了access level修饰外），可以返回这个对象的copy
